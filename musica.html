                A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
                Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
                While I recall all the words you spoke to me
                Can't help but wish that I was there
                At where I'd love to be, oh, yeah

                Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
                Is to hold her when I'm not around
                When I'm much too far away
                We all need that person who can be true to you
                But I left her when I found her
                And now I wish I'd stayed

                'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
                I'm missing you again, oh, no
                Once again

                There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
                There's no one here while the city sleeps
                And all the shops are closed
                Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
                Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh, yeah

                Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
                Is to hold her when I'm not around
                When I'm much too far away
                We all need that person who can be true to you
                But I left her when I found her
                And now I wish I'd stayed

                'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
                I'm missing you again, oh, no
                Once again

                Some search, never finding a way
                Before long, they waste away
                I found you, something told me to stay
                I gave in to selfish ways

                And how I miss someone to hold
                When hope begins to fade

                A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
                Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find

                Dear God, the only thing I ask of You
                Is to hold her when I'm not around
                When I'm much too far away
                We all need that person who can be true to you
                But I left her when I found her
                And now I wish I'd stayed

                'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
                I'm missing you again, oh, no
                Once again

                Hey (oh, oh), yeah, yeah

                It starts with one, one thing, I don't know why
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try
                Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
                All I know, time is a valuable thing
                Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
                Watch it count down to the end of the day, the clock ticks life away
                It's so unreal, didn't look out below
                Watch the time go right out the window
                Tryna hold on, d-didn't even know
                I wasted it all just to watch you go
                I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
                What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                One thing, I don't know why
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try
                Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
                To remind myself how I tried so hard
                In spite of the way you were mockin' me
                Actin' like I was part of your property
                Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
                I'm surprised it got so far
                Things aren't the way they were before
                You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
                Not that you knew me back then, but it all comes back to me in the end
                You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
                What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I've put my trust in you
                Pushed as far as I can go
                For all this, there's only one thing you should know
                I've put my trust in you
                Pushed as far as I can go
                For all this, there's only one thing you should know
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter

                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
                Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
                I don't know what you're expecting of me
                Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
                Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you
                Can't you see that you're smothering me?
                Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
                'Cause everything that you thought I would be
                Has fallen apart right in front of you
                Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
                And every second I waste is more than I can take
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you
                And I know
                I may end up failing too
                But I know
                You were just like me, with someone disappointed in you
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                Become so tired, so much more aware
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Is be more like me and be less like you
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
                I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                I'm tired of being what you want me to be
